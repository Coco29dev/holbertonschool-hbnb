Projectt HBnB
## 1. Introduction
The HBnB Evolution project aims to develop a simplified application inspired by Airbnb, allowing users to manage properties, leave reviews, and manage associated amenities. The first phase of the project focuses on creating technical documentation that will serve as the foundation for the system's design. This documentation will detail the overall architecture, business processes, and interactions between system entities, ensuring a clear understanding of the project. The goal is to lay the groundwork for scalable and flexible development.
